# SOC Lab Demos

## Overview
**SOC Lab Demos** is a project designed to simulate common cyber attacks and generate logs that can be analyzed in a SOC environment.  
It helps blue-teamers and SOC analysts to practice detection, monitoring, and incident response using real attack simulations.

## Features
- Brute-force attack simulation (SSH)
- Port scanning simulation
- Log generation (JSON format)
- Export logs to ELK/Graylog
- Useful for SOC training and demos

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add brute_force attack
- [ ] Add port_scan attack
- [ ] Implement log formatter
- [ ] ELK / Graylog integration
